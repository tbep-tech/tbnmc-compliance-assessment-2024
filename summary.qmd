Results from {{< var maxyr >}} indicate that all RA bay segments met chlorophyll-a thresholds accepted by the FDEP to maintain FDEP Reasonable Assurance for Tampa Bay and to comply with the EPA TMDL (@fig-thrplot) and estuarine numeric nutrient criteria for Tampa Bay ([EPA Amended Approval Letter Jun. 28, 2013](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-04/documents/florida-amended-determination.pdf)). During the previous RA period (2017-2021), Old Tampa Bay exceeded the chlorophyll-a threshold for four of the five years.  While the chlorophyll-a threshold was met in Old Tampa Bay for the 2022 and 2023 annual assessment periods, water quality conditions in this bay segment remain a priority concern for the Consortium.  Chlorophyll-a concentrations are typically elevated in a poorly flushed region that has produced summertime blooms of *Pyrodinium bahamense* since 2009 (@fig-sitemap; *Note that individual station exceedences are not considered in this RA compliance assessment*). This observation is reflected in the majority of summertime months with chlorophyll-a concentrations higher than long-term median values in Old Tampa Bay, although this was not observed in 2022 or 2023 (@fig-boxplot). To address these water quality problems, the Consortium formed an Old Tampa Bay Working Group in early 2020 to prioritize additional investigations and future management actions that may alleviate the conditions fostering these summertime blooms. Additionally, the TBEP received funding from a NOAA Restore Actionable Science grant in 2021 to develop a research management plan for identifying potential actions to improve water quality conditions in Old Tampa Bay [@tbep1223].  An assimilative capacity study for Old Tampa Bay will also be pursued in 2024 to evaluate the existing management paradigm and assess the potential need to adopt alternative indicators and/or load allocations to address recurring water quality issues in that bay segment.

The TBEP, in partnership with the Southwest Florida Water Management District, has previously developed an integrated ecosystem model to evaluate the net environmental benefits that may result from implementing various management actions in Old Tampa Bay including: reducing point sources, nonpoint sources, and causeway obstructions in Old Tampa Bay [@tbep1015]. Management actions that proximate and respond to current Old Tampa Bay conditions will be further evaluated using this model. Furthermore, the TBEP funded research conducted by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute to improve understanding of the cell physiology and behavior of *Pyrodinium bahamense* and evaluate the potential for using shellfish to mitigate these algal blooms in Old Tampa Bay.  A water quality dashboard ([https://shiny.tbep.org/wq-dash](https://shiny.tbep.org/wq-dash)) continues to be available to further synthesize available data, assess additional water quality metrics (phytoplankton counts), and inform Consortium participants and other resource managers on the status of water quality in Tampa Bay. The dashboard allows for proactive response to anomalous water quality conditions on a month-to-month basis by the community.  Potential modifications to existing modeling tools and the proposal of additional models will be explored under the Old Tampa Bay assimilative capacity assessment study in 2024.

Seagrasses were relatively stable in much of Lower to Middle Tampa Bay; however, additional declines to the ephemeral seagrass beds in upper Tampa Bay were observed between 2020 and 2022. Aerial photographs taken in December 2021 - January 2022 indicated that baywide seagrass coverage decreased by 4,160 acres, marking the third consecutive biennial reporting period with seagrass declines. Seagrass acreage showed the greatest decreases in Old Tampa Bay (-4,041 acres from 2018 - 2020, -2,518 acres from 2020 - 2022) and Hillsborough Bay (-627 acres from 2018 - 2020, -428 acres from 2020 - 2022). Notably, the coverage estimate for Old Tampa Bay was 4,183 acres in 2022, the lowest estimate ever recorded for that bay segment.  The three major southwest Florida estuaries experienced reductions in estimated seagrass coverage between 2020 and 2022, with the most pronounced losses occurring in Tampa Bay. Additional research and discussion is being pursued by the Southwest Florida Seagrass Working Group to better understand the underlying mechanisms influencing these observations. The next SWFWMD seagrass coverage estimate will be developed from aerial photographs acquired over the winter 2023-24 period.  Despite the documented baywide decline in seagrass coverage shown by the SWFWMD data, the previous two years of annual transect surveys conducted by TBEP and its partners have shown a slight increase in total frequency occurrence from 2021 to 2023 (shown in the [seagrass transect dashboard](https://shiny.tbep.org/seagrasstransect-dash)). Although lower stormwater nutrient loads from lower than average summer rainfall may have contributed to this increase, the TBEP is cautiously optimistic that these increases will continue in future years.  Finally, the role of long-term temperature increases and salinity reductions related to climate change and the potential relationships with seagrass declines since 2016 are being explored. The results of this work will likely be published in early 2024.

Detailed results for the 2022-2026 RA implementation period are provided in Tables [-@tbl-raotb], [-@tbl-rahb], [-@tbl-ramtb], [-@tbl-raltb], and [-@tbl-raraltb] for each bay segment. Notably, results for the Remainder Lower Tampa Bay segment (Boca Ciega Bay South, Terra Ceia Bay, Manatee River) are included for the first time in this annual assessment. As of the {{< var maxyr >}} reporting period, NMC Actions 2-5 are not necessary based upon observed water quality conditions within Tampa Bay, though additional work is being pursued by the TBEP and TBNMC to understand the most recent trends in seagrass coverage and Old Tampa Bay's current assimilative capacity. Individual annual reports of the bay’s conditions from {{< var maxyr >}} can be found on the TBEP website, as specified in the following link [@tbep0124] and the [water quality dashboard](https://shiny.tbep.org/wq-dash). A summary of historic attainment of the regulatory chlorophyll-a thresholds for each of the bay segments is depicted in @fig-chlmat.

Lastly, annual hydrologic conditions within two of the major bay segments in {{< var maxyr >}} were below 1992-1994 levels ([@tbl-hydrotab]). Therefore, hydrologic adjustments for evaluating compliance with individual entity load allocations/permitting targets should be applied for the Middle Tampa Bay and Lower Tampa Bay segments [@tbep0512;@tbep0316]. The estimated hydrologic loads for each bay segment relative to observed 1992-1994 levels are indicated in the table below. The estimated compliance load adjustment factors (if applicable) are also specified. A tool to calculate the hydrologic estimates and adjustment factors by bay segment is available online through an interactive dashboard and automatically updated as provisional hydrologic estimates are approved by monitoring agencies (<https://shiny.tbep.org/tbnmc_hydrologic_estimates/>).
